        Creates a Saver to save the variables from the provided session. Exports the
        corresponding meta graph def. This function assumes that the variables to be
        saved have been initialized. For a given `SavedModelBuilder`, this API must
        be called exactly once and for the first meta graph to save. For subsequent
        meta graph defs to be added, the `add_meta_graph()` API must be used.

            variables.

            def.
